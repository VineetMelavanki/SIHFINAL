## üîß Technical Implementation

### Blockchain Features
```typescript
// Smart Contract Validation Example
validateTransaction(type: "collection", data: {
  coordinates: "26.9124, 75.7873",
  species: "Withania somnifera", 
  quantity: 25.5,
  quality: "Premium"
});
```

### Supply Chain Events
1. **Collection Event**: GPS coordinates, collector ID, species, quantity
2. **Transport Event**: Temperature monitoring, custody transfer
3. **Testing Event**: Lab results, quality certificates
4. **Processing Event**: Manufacturing details, batch formation
5. **Packaging Event**: QR code generation, labeling
6. **Distribution Event**: Supply chain completion

### Data Standards
- **FHIR-style Metadata**: Standardized healthcare data exchange
- **GPS Coordinates**: Precise location tracking
- **DNA Barcoding**: Species authentication
- **Quality Parameters**: AYUSH-compliant testing

## üå± Supported Herbs

The system includes comprehensive data for major Ayurvedic herbs:
