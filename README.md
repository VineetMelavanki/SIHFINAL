# AyurTrace - Blockchain Herbal Traceability System

## Smart India Hackathon 2024 - Ministry of AYUSH

A comprehensive blockchain-based botanical traceability system for Ayurvedic herbs, ensuring authenticity, sustainability, and transparency from farm to consumer.
## HerbTrace - Blockchain Herbal Traceability System

HerbTrace is a blockchain-based botanical traceability system for Ayurvedic herbs, providing end-to-end transparency from collection to consumer. This repository contains a proof-of-concept frontend that demonstrates scanning, tracing, and stakeholder portals for collectors, manufacturers, and consumers.

## 🌿 Project Overview

Problem: Lack of verifiable, tamper-resistant traceability in the Ayurvedic herb supply chain.

Solution: HerbTrace uses an immutable ledger (simulated in the demo) and QR-based consumer-facing verification to improve authenticity and sustainability.
